# Security Policy

## Threat Model

This document outlines the security considerations and threat model for the VTE Terminal Emulator.

### Attack Vectors

#### 1. Malicious Escape Sequences
**Risk:** High
- **Description:** Attackers could send malicious ANSI escape sequences to cause resource exhaustion, code injection, or other harmful effects
- **Examples:**
  - Extremely long OSC sequences to exhaust memory
  - Rapid SGR changes to cause performance issues
  - Malformed sequences to trigger parser errors

**Mitigations:**
- Input length limits (MAX_PARAMS=32, MAX_OSC_LEN=2048)
- Parameter value limits (MAX_PARAM_VALUE=9999)
- Safe parsing with bounds checking
- Error recovery without panicking

#### 2. Paste-Based Attacks
**Risk:** Medium
- **Description:** Malicious content pasted into the terminal could execute commands or exploit vulnerabilities
- **Examples:**
  - Commands that delete files or modify system settings
  - Escape sequences that change terminal behavior
  - Binary data that crashes the parser

**Mitigations:**
- Bracketed paste mode enabled by default
- Paste sanitization removes dangerous characters
- Optional OSC sequence filtering
- User confirmation for potentially dangerous pastes

#### 3. File URI Exposure in OSC Sequences
**Risk:** Low-Medium
- **Description:** OSC 7 sequences contain file:// URIs that could expose local file paths
- **Examples:**
  - Directory traversal via malicious OSC 7
  - Information disclosure through path exposure

**Mitigations:**
- OSC 7 parsing validates URI format
- Path sanitization removes dangerous characters
- Optional OSC sequence filtering

#### 4. Resource Exhaustion
**Risk:** Medium
- **Description:** Large amounts of data could exhaust memory or CPU resources
- **Examples:**
  - Massive scrollback buffer
  - Rapid terminal resizing
  - Excessive hyperlink creation

**Mitigations:**
- Memory limits for scrollback buffer (<50MB)
- Rate limiting for resize operations
- Bounded data structures with overflow protection

## Security Features

### Input Sanitization
- All input validated against maximum lengths
- Dangerous characters filtered or escaped
- UTF-8 validation with replacement characters

### Safe Defaults
- Bracketed paste mode enabled by default
- Mouse reporting disabled by default
- OSC sequence processing can be disabled
- Conservative resource limits

### Error Recovery
- Parser errors don't crash the application
- Invalid sequences are safely ignored
- Resource cleanup on errors

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

### How to Report
If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

**Email:** security@hugovte.dev
**Response Time:** We aim to respond within 48 hours
**Coordinated Disclosure:** We support coordinated vulnerability disclosure

### What to Include
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if available)
- Your contact information (optional)

### Process
1. **Acknowledgment:** We'll confirm receipt within 48 hours
2. **Investigation:** We'll investigate the issue promptly
3. **Fix Development:** We'll develop and test a fix
4. **Coordinated Release:** We'll coordinate disclosure timing
5. **Public Disclosure:** After fix is available, we'll publish details

### Bug Bounty
We don't currently offer a formal bug bounty program, but we greatly appreciate security research and may provide:
- Public acknowledgment
- Free access to premium features
- Contribution to open source projects

## Security Updates

### Release Process
- Security fixes are prioritized over new features
- Critical vulnerabilities get immediate patch releases
- Users are notified of security updates

### Version Support
- Latest version receives full security support
- Previous version receives critical security fixes only
- Older versions receive no security support

### Update Recommendations
- Keep dependencies updated
- Monitor security advisories
- Test updates in staging before production deployment

## Best Practices for Users

### Terminal Configuration
```bash
# Enable additional security features
export VTE_SECURITY_LEVEL=high

# Disable potentially dangerous features in untrusted environments
export VTE_DISABLE_OSC=1
export VTE_DISABLE_MOUSE=1
```

### Application Integration
- Validate all input before sending to terminal
- Use bracketed paste mode for user input
- Sanitize clipboard content before pasting
- Limit terminal session duration for untrusted users

### Monitoring
- Monitor for unusual terminal behavior
- Log security-relevant events
- Set up alerts for resource usage spikes
- Regular security audits of terminal usage

## Compliance

This project follows security best practices for terminal emulators and aims to meet or exceed:
- Common Criteria Protection Profile for Terminal Applications
- NIST SP 800-53 security controls
- OWASP Terminal Application Security guidelines
